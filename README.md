# PythonComputer is a simple python program (no display) that simulates a computer. 
>This Program isn't finished and will be updated time to time!
This repo has multiple .py modules you can use in your daily programs!

There will be additional elements which you can add to on your own. 
# 2019 or older .py files
Hey there! If your looking for anything that isn't 2019py, it won't be updated!
With this new 2019py file. Its consuming most of my time so I won't be able to work on it. 
Be sure to check 2019py out!

# INSTALATION/ IDE Setup
1) Download the ZIP folder
2) Download Visual Studio Code or PyCharm
VSC: https://code.visualstudio.com/
PyCharm: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/
3) Follow their installation process
4) Download https://github.com/Space-Turtle0/PythonComputer/blob/master/2019pc.py
5) Open the Zip Folder
6) Make sure you open with VSC or PyCharm! Otherwise you won't be able to edit it.
7) Congrats! You now have access to the folder.
If you just want to run it without editing...
Open it with command prompt.

# My command line keep crashes!
Well that shouldn't be happening. Instead of using command prompt, download one of the code editors above and run it in there. If there are any syntax issues that pop up, please open an issue so we can fix it!

# Help! What do I download?

Well it really depends on you.

# Warning:
Any unintentional change may cause a problem during execution! 
If you did by mistake check the original file and revert the changes.
*Or just do Ctrl + Z*
Otherwise, make sure you know what your doing before making a crucial change!

# [New Python Computer]
- If you're using the new 2019pc.py
Its straight forward. 
>>> Adding on to the file!
To setup a branch, add the following
```
if appchoice == "Your Portion Name":
    print("Move on from here")
```
Use that ^ to move on with the file!

>>> Setting up before execution
*This type of execution should be used only if you need to reset variables on startup*
*If you need to compare values inside the `while des == y` loop, place it before asking what to open*

```
import time, webbrowser, os, warnings
time.sleep(3)
websitechoicetf = False
filetf = False
```
This is an example startup as soon as you run the program.

> **If you need to reset values inside the loop**
Place your `define` statements after asking about `appchoice`!
