- If you're using the new 2019pc.py
Its straight forward. 
>>> Adding on to the file!
To setup a branch, add the following
```
if appchoice == "Your Portion Name":
    print("Move on from here")
```
Use that ^ to move on with the file!

>>> Setting up before execution
```
import time, webbrowser, os, warnings
time.sleep(3)
websitechoicetf == False
filetf == False
```
This is an example startup.
If you need to reset values or import modules. Do it there!
