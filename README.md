>Open the Zip Folder
>Make sure you open with VSC or PyCharm! Otherwise you won't be able to edit it.

>>>Customizability
You will see in the folder 2 variables.
Location or/and pass
>IF you see the variable pass,
This is just the "default" password, you can change it to whatever you want.

>IF you see the variable location
It normally means give the location of a file. 
[WARNING:] It is best you give a new and empty txt file! 
Otherwise you might hit some error. Don't expect your old txt file to be as it is.
Python will most likely erase it and follow the script!
