Hey there! If your looking for anything that isn't 2019py, it won't be updated!

# I keep getting a error about `b.color`
Its your IDE or whatever your using. I suggest you use PyCharm or something else that supports classes. If you think that this is an issue, please submit an issue. 
**In All**
I don't suggest you use online IDE's, they have some restrictions which this program uses. (PCv2) Use something like PyCharm or VSC (*Found above*). If you really want to execute this on your version. Remove b.colors, class, f, and anything associated with the class color. Please sumbit an issue if the problem persists on desktop (IDE) applications!

# [New Python Computer]
- If you're using the new 2019pc.py
Its straight forward. 
>>> Adding on to the file!
To setup a branch, add the following
```
if appchoice == "Your Portion Name":
    print("Move on from here")
```
Use that ^ to move on with the file!

>>> Setting up before execution
```
import time, webbrowser, os, warnings
time.sleep(3)
websitechoicetf = False
filetf = False
```
This is an example startup.
If you need to reset values or import modules. Do it there!
